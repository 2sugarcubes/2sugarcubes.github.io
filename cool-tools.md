# Things that made this site possible

## [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

The static site builder that this website is built on.

## [Rose Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/)

The color scheme I have shamelessly used for everything from [my text editor](#neo-vim-and-lazy-nvim), to my console, to this website.

## [Psychcool](https://psychcool.org/)

If it wasn't for [this video](https://piped.video/watch?v=zswyWBtF-7Y) I never would have gone and made this whole thing.

## [Neo vim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) and [lazy nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

My text editor of choice after using VS code and Visual Studio for several years and getting tired of the bloat.

# Podcasts I listen to

## [The Magnus Archives](https://rustyquill.com/show/the-magnus-archives/)

[feed](http://rss.acast.com/themagnusarchives)

The Magnus Archives needs to be heard to be believed. The Scariest podcast I have ever heard.

p.s. don't believe the lies, you _need_ to listen to Archives before you listen to Protocol.

## [Knowlege Fight](https://knowledgefight.com/)

[feed](http://feeds.libsyn.com/92106/rss)

Two comedians let you know why you should keep four eyes on Alex Jones at all times.

## [Boonta Vista](https://boontavista.com/)

[feed](http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:307723090/sounds.rss)

A lighter take on the news and current events podcast genre. Might I recommend [Thick With Weasels](https://soundcloud.com/boontavista/episode-238) for your first episode?

# Tools I Use

## [Azgaar's Fantasy Map Generator](https://azgaar.github.io/Fantasy-Map-Generator/)

This is an incredible map generator that is absurdly feature rich and developed at a rate that I can only dream of competing with. It is a bit heavy weight for most computers, but it is worth a look.
