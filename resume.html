      I ensured safety for both customers and employees while refuling boats.
      This involved tasks such as directing boats in at a safe speed and
      trajectory, inspecting fuel lines for leaks periodically, cleaning fuel
      spills if they occured, etc. Additionally, I reported earnings, and inventory
      once a day, and incidents as they occured.

      I managed a group of 18 employees, making sure they received their
      necesary breaks, were working at peak efficency, and the code of conduct
      in the workplace was upheald. In addition to ensuring the workplace was
      safe (e.g. clear of ice, employees could seek a safe temperature on cold
      days, filling in for sick employees, filing a report for workplace
      harrassment)
